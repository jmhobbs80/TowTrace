# TowTrace Testing: Next Steps

We've made significant progress implementing comprehensive testing across the TowTrace codebase, but there are still important areas to address. This document outlines the next steps for continuing to improve the testing infrastructure.

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Frontend Component Tests

- **Dashboard Pages**: Create tests for critical dashboard pages like `dashboard/jobs/page.tsx` and `dashboard/eld-logs/page.tsx`
- **Form Components**: Test form validation and submission behavior
- **Authentication Flow**: Test authentication flow end-to-end
- **Data Fetching**: Test API fetching and error handling

### 2. Backend Controllers

- **ELD Controller**: Test ELD telemetry processing and HOS calculations
- **Overwatch Controller**: Test tenant management functionality
- **Driver Documents**: Test document expiration tracking

### 3. Mobile App Integration

- **Job Tracker Screen**: Test job tracking functionality, especially GPS integration
- **VIN Scanner**: Test camera integration and VIN recognition
- **Offline Queue**: Test the entire offline queue synchronization flow

## Mid-term Goals (Next 2-4 Weeks)

### 1. End-to-End Testing

- **Setup Cypress Testing**: Implement Cypress for web dashboard E2E tests
- **Critical User Flows**: Test job creation, assignment, and completion flow
- **Authentication Flow**: Test login, permissions, and protected routes

### 2. Visual Regression Testing

- **Setup Storybook**: Implement Storybook for component documentation
- **Component Screenshots**: Add visual testing for UI components
- **Responsive Testing**: Test on different screen sizes

### 3. Performance Testing

- **API Performance**: Test performance of critical API endpoints
- **Load Testing**: Simulate multiple simultaneous users
- **Database Query Optimization**: Test and optimize database queries

## Long-term Testing Strategy (3+ Months)

### 1. Testing Infrastructure

- **Test Environment**: Create dedicated test environment with test database
- **Continuous Testing**: Run full test suite nightly
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Establish baseline performance metrics and alert on degradation

### 2. Test Coverage Goals

- **Backend**: Reach 80% code coverage
- **Frontend/Mobile**: Reach 75% code coverage
- **Critical Components**: Reach 90% coverage for authentication, subscription checks, and data validation

### 3. User Testing

- **User Testing Sessions**: Organize structured testing with actual users
- **Feedback Collection**: Create system for collecting and addressing test feedback
- **Accessibility Testing**: Ensure application meets accessibility standards

## Integration with Development Process

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Currently implemented for local development
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
3. **Pull Request Requirements**: All PRs must maintain or improve test coverage
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation with testing requirements and best practices

## Resources Required

- **Team Training**: Schedule session on testing best practices
- **Test Data**: Create comprehensive test datasets
- **Mobile Device Testing**: Access to various iOS and Android devices for testing
- **Test Time Allocation**: Reserve 20% of development time for testing

By following this plan, we'll continue to build on our testing foundation and create a robust, reliable application with high-quality code.
