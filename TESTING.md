# TowTrace Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing approach for the TowTrace application ecosystem, including the backend API, web dashboard, and mobile applications.

## Test Coverage

The testing strategy focuses on comprehensive test coverage across all components:

### Backend API (Jest)
- **Authentication & Security**: JWT validation, role-based access control, and permission checks
- **Subscription Management**: Feature access based on subscription tier
- **Data Validation**: Schema validation with Zod
- **API Controllers**: Request handling and response formatting
- **Middleware**: Auth, roles, and subscription checks
- **API Endpoints**: Task management, ELD, drivers, and other core functionality

### Web Dashboard (Jest + React Testing Library)
- **Context Providers**: Auth, notification, and state management
- **Components**: Reusable UI components like tables, cards, and forms
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks for data fetching, auth, and other functionality
- **Services**: API integration, data processing, and business logic
- **Utilities**: Helper functions for formatting, validation, and calculations

### Mobile Applications (Jest + React Native Testing Library)
- **Services**: API integration, device interactions, and offline capabilities
- **Screens**: UI components and user interactions
- **Hooks**: Device features, authentication, and state management
- **Offline Queue**: Data synchronization when connectivity is restored
- **Location Tracking**: Battery-friendly GPS implementation

## Test Structure

Each test file follows this structure:
1. **Imports and Mocks**: Import components and mock dependencies
2. **Test Data**: Define test fixtures and constants
3. **Test Suites**: Organized in describe blocks by feature
4. **Test Cases**: Individual test scenarios with clear descriptions
5. **Assertions**: Verify expected outcomes with expect statements

## Testing Tools

### Backend
- **Jest**: Test runner and assertion library
- **TypeScript**: Type checking for test code
- **ESLint**: Code quality and consistency

### Frontend (Web)
- **Jest**: Test runner and assertion library
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing with user-centric approach
- **TypeScript**: Type checking for test code
- **ESLint**: Code quality and consistency

### Mobile
- **Jest**: Test runner and assertion library
- **React Native Testing Library**: Mobile component testing
- **Mock Implementations**: For native modules and device features
- **TypeScript**: Type checking for test code
- **ESLint**: Code quality and consistency

## Running Tests

### Local Development

Run tests for individual components:

```bash
# Backend API tests
cd backend/towtrace-api
npm test

# Web Dashboard tests
cd frontend/towtrace-dashboard-new
npm test

# Driver App tests
cd mobile/TowTraceDriverApp-New
npm test
```

Run all tests with the provided script:

```bash
./run-tests.sh
```

### Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions workflow automatically runs tests on:
- Push to master branch
- Pull requests to master branch

Each component (backend, frontend, mobile) is tested in parallel for efficiency.

## Testing Best Practices

1. **Write Tests First**: Adopt test-driven development (TDD) where possible
2. **Test Business Logic**: Focus on critical business rules and user flows
3. **Mock External Dependencies**: Isolate tests from external APIs and services
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Include error handling, boundary cases, and unusual inputs
5. **Keep Tests Fast**: Optimize for quick feedback during development
6. **Test for Accessibility**: Ensure components meet accessibility standards
7. **Maintain Test Quality**: Refactor tests when refactoring code

## Key Test Files

### Backend
- `auth.test.ts`: Authentication middleware tests
- `subscriptionCheck.test.ts`: Subscription access tests
- `HoursOfService.test.ts`: Data validation tests
- `taskCreate.test.ts`: API endpoint tests

### Frontend
- `auth-context.test.tsx`: Authentication context tests
- `locationUtils.test.ts`: Utility function tests
- `GPSTrackingService.test.ts`: Service tests
- `AuthService.test.ts`: Authentication service tests

### Mobile
- `EldService.test.ts`: ELD service integration tests
- `useAuth.test.ts`: Authentication hook tests

## Coverage Requirements

- **Functions**: 70% minimum coverage
- **Statements**: 70% minimum coverage
- **Branches**: 70% minimum coverage
- **Lines**: 70% minimum coverage

Coverage is enforced through Jest configuration and CI checks.

## Future Improvements

1. **End-to-End Testing**: Add Cypress or Playwright tests for critical user flows
2. **Visual Regression Testing**: Implement Storybook and visual testing
3. **Load Testing**: Add performance testing for API endpoints
4. **Mobile Device Testing**: Expand testing on physical devices and emulators
5. **Snapshot Testing**: Add component snapshot tests for UI stability
