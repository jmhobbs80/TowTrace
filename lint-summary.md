# TowTrace Lint Summary

## Overview
The linting process has identified several issues across the TowTrace project that need to be addressed to improve code quality, maintainability, and adherence to project standards.

## Critical Issues

### 1. Missing JSDoc Comments
**Problem**: The vast majority of functions, components, and interfaces lack proper JSDoc documentation.

**Solution**:
- Add JSDoc comments to all exported functions/components following the template in `function-comment-template.md`
- Include descriptions, parameters, return values, and examples
- Prioritize code in high-traffic areas like auth context, controllers, and middlewares

**Example locations**:
- `src/app/context/auth-context.tsx`
- `src/app/dashboard/**/*.tsx`
- `src/controllers/*.ts`
- `src/middlewares/*.ts`

### 2. Functions Over 50 Lines
**Problem**: Several functions exceed the 50-line limit, making them harder to test and maintain.

**Solution**:
- Refactor large functions into smaller, focused functions
- Extract repeated logic into utility functions
- Simplify complex conditional logic

**Example locations**:
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (multiple functions)
- `src/controllers/*.ts` (API endpoint handlers)

### 3. File Naming Convention Issues
**Problem**: Many file names don't match their primary export/component.

**Solution**:
- Rename files to match their primary export/component
- Use PascalCase for component files
- Use camelCase for utility/service files

**Example issues**:
- `auth-context.tsx` exports `useAuth`
- `page.tsx` exports `Home`
- `App.tsx` exports `AuthContext`
- `DriverDocument.ts` exports `EXPIRY_REQUIRED_DOCUMENTS`

### 4. Magic Numbers
**Problem**: Codebase uses numerous magic numbers instead of named constants.

**Solution**:
- Replace magic numbers with descriptive constant names
- Group related constants in dedicated constants files
- Add comments explaining the significance of unusual values

**Example locations**:
- Most UI components (margins, durations, limits)
- API controllers (status codes, timeouts, limits)

### 5. Commented-Out Code
**Problem**: Commented-out code blocks found in multiple files.

**Solution**:
- Remove all commented-out code, relying on git history if needed
- Add TODO comments for intentionally incomplete features
- Document alternative approaches with explanatory comments

**Example locations**:
- `src/app/dashboard/documents/page.tsx`
- `screens/DriverWallet.tsx`

### 6. Missing Package Scripts
**Problem**: Essential package.json scripts are missing from most components.

**Solution**:
- Add consistent scripts to all package.json files:
  - `typecheck`: Run TypeScript compiler
  - `test`: Run unit tests
  - `build`: Build for production
  - `dev`: Run development server
  - `lint`: Run linting checks

## Next Steps

1. **High Priority**:
   - Add JSDoc comments to all exported functions/components
   - Remove commented-out code
   - Add missing package.json scripts

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Refactor functions over 50 lines
   - Rename files to match their primary exports

3. **Lower Priority**:
   - Replace magic numbers with named constants
   - Improve error handling and validation
   - Add more comprehensive test coverage

## Automation Recommendations

1. Configure ESLint rules to enforce JSDoc comments on exports
2. Add a pre-commit hook to prevent functions over 50 lines
3. Create a PR template that includes the Mermaid diagram
4. Set up CI/CD to run linting, type checking, and tests automatically
