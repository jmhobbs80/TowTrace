## Conclusion

The project has seen significant improvement in test coverage for critical services and utilities. Component testing has been established with several key components now having comprehensive tests. The testing infrastructure is now in place to support ongoing development with high confidence in code quality and reliability.

The highest priority for future testing work is to expand coverage for UI components and pages, as these areas currently have lower coverage compared to the backend services and utilities.
