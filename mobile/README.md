# TowTrace Mobile Apps

## Dependencies Update Summary

I've updated all dependencies across the mobile apps to ensure compatibility:

### Main Changes:

1. **React Versions**:
   - Downgraded from React 19 to React 18.2.0 (stable version)
   - Updated React Native to 0.72.7 (stable version)

2. **React Native Dependencies**:
   - Aligned React Native Navigation to stable versions (6.x)
   - Fixed version mismatches in React Native libraries

3. **Development Dependencies**:
   - Updated TypeScript to compatible versions
   - Fixed build tool versions to work with respective frameworks

### How to Apply Changes:

For mobile apps:
```
cd mobile/TowTraceDriverApp  # or TowTraceDispatchApp
npm install
```

These updates ensure all dependencies are properly aligned with current stable versions that work together.
